          <h1>UI & UX</h1>
          <p>You need a foundation for a successful realization of your ideas and dreams.
             Before I start creating websites I will make a complete analysis on the basis of which I will create you a tailored concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concept will be transformed into a wireframe. The wireframe is a basic model of the website that clearly shows how your website
            could look and where the specific elements will be deployed on the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            UX design is about developing product/website that is both usable and user-centric. Your website will be designed with targeted customers
            in mind. The customers will easily find on your website what they look for and your business will grow.
          </p>

          <h2>Wireframe</h2>
          <p>
            Based on the analysis and concept I make a professional wireframe of your future website. A wireframe shows how your website could look
            and where the specific elements will be deployed on the website and through the wireframe, you will understand the structure and functionality of the website.
          </p>

          <h1>Website development</h1>
          <p>Do you have a business and sell goods or services to customers? In that case is useful to have a website nowadays. Your new website can be as much about customer service
             as it is about selling products and services. The website serves as a great presentation of your business that will bring you new customers. If you don't have a website,
             you're missing out on opportunities for customers to identify who you are, what you offer and if they want to spend money with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your new website will be:
          </p>
          <h2>Benefit for your business</h2>
          <p>
            You can attract a lot of new customers with a website. Online shopping is constantly growing in popularity. Most people search the product or service online before
            making a purchase decision. A website is like a store opens 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Having a website gives you a possibility to communicate with your customers
            at any time and customers can find necessary information about a product, service that your business offers at any moment.
          </p>
          <h2>Modern and unique</h2>
          <p>
            I will create a unique design in regard to the latest design trends. The unique design will differentiate your business from competition, customers will easily remember
            you and your business will stand out from the crowd of competitors on the market.
          </p>
          <h2>Usable and user-centric website</h2>
          <p>
            Every website represents a business with its unique goals and ideas. Therefore the website has to meet business objectives as well as customer needs. Your new website
            will be user-centered and designed with company's target group in mind.

          <h1>Graphic design</h1>
          <p>Graphic design is a necessary part of a website. Together with the creation of websites and online stores, therefore I offer you also a realization of graphic design.
             I will create a complex graphic that along with your website communicates the vision and message of your company.

            Graphic design is part of a marketing communication of your company that represents your business to your customers, suppliers and competitors alike. With a creative graphic design
            your company will remain in customer's mind for a long time and graphic design will differentiate your company from competition.

          <p>
            A logo is a graphic mark or symbol and it's a vital part of the marketing that represents your company or brand. Since your logo is a critical element of your brand and usually
            the first thing a client sees, designing one that resonates has to be a top priority. I will create you a memorable logo that you can identify with, while the logo will be simple and easy to remember.
